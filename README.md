# Data Analytics Project: NYC Airbnb 2024

## Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data for New York City as of January 5, 2024. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/new-york-dataset). The primary objectives of this project are to organize the data, store it in an SQLite3 database, and create a Power BI dashboard for visual exploration.

## Project Structure

-   **/Airbnb PowerBi Dashboard.pdf**: Includes pdf snapshot of the dashboard created using PowerBi.
-   **/Airbnb Project Dashboard.pbix**: Includes interactive PowerBI dashboard file used to visualize data relating to the dataset.
-  **/database.db**: Stores the SQLite3 database file.
- **/project_summary.pdf**: The pdf summary of findings of the project.
-   **/new_york_listings_2024.csv**: Contains the raw CSV file downloaded from Kaggle.
-   **/sample_queries.sql**: Includes example queries that may be run on the database.db file.
-   **/schema.sql**: Contains all tables created to assist in data querying.


## Steps to Replicate

1.  **Download Data**: Obtain the dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/new-york-dataset) or download /new_york_listings_2024.csv.

2. **Create SQLite3 Database**: 
	- Ensure all relevant files are in the same directory.
	- Run the following commands in your Linux terminal: 
	```bash 
	sqlite3 database.db 
	.read schema.sql
	```
	- These commands open the SQLite3 shell, apply the database schema using the `schema.sql` file, import data from the CSV file into the SQLite3 database and populate tables derived from the primary table "all_listings".

4.  **Power BI Dashboard**:
    
    -   Open Power BI and connect to the SQLite3 database.
	- Follow these steps to connect Power BI to the SQLite3 database:
	    - Click on "Get Data" in "Home" section
	    - Select the "More" option,
	    - Choose "Other".
	    - Click "ODBC" and then select "Connect"
	    - Choose DSN (Data source name) "SQLite3 Datasource."
	    -  Click the drop-down for "Advanced Option"
	    - Enter "Database \(or whichever name you prefer) =" followed by the file path to the database file.
	    - Use your current credentials to authorize. 
    -   Load data and create visualizations using the tables and relationships defined in the database.
